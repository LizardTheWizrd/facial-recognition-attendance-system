//Webcam//
- Integrate previous webcam mtcnn code to show info when detecting a face in terminal *DONE*
- Fix slow frame rate during live detection *DONE*
- Live detection with webcam (check youtube videos) *DONE*
- Detect multiple faces during live detection *DONE*


//Dataset//
- Add data augmentation to training dataset? *EXPERIMENTAL*
- Add our faces to dataset and re-train model (save the model with different name) *DONE*
- Extract faces from images using mtcnn before training the model *DONE*


//Concerns//
- Model recognises a face that was not included in the training (recognises unknown face as person who matches most)
- Model predicts different answers depending on distance to webcam (further = wrong predictions)
- Different number of images in each students' folder for training/validation
- Where and how to apply image processing
